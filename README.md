# Fast-Prime-Sum
A fast algorithm to calculate sum of primes under specific numbers.

This algorithm comes from http://www.zhihu.com/question/29580448 (in Chinese)

I implement it in C language.

The idea of this algorithm adapted from [Legendre's Formula](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LegendresFormula.html).
